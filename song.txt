Song -- "Bhag milkha Bhag"

Arre shanti maar raha sansaar	The entire world is sitting peacefully
Ab tu aane de lalkaar	Now you create an uproar
Teri toh baahein patwaar	Your arms are like a paddle
Kadam hai tere hahakaar	Your feet are like an outcry
Teri nas nas loha taar	Every vein of yours is like iron
Tu hai aag Milkha	Milkha, you're like fire
O bas tu bhaag Milkha
